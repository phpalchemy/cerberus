------------

## Authors and contributors

## Requirements
Cerberus RBAC is only supported on PHP 5.4 3 and up.

## Development
Cerberus RBAC uses [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage dependencies.
```

If you just want to get the project dependencies, instead of building everything:

```
git clone https://github.com/klaussilveira/gitlist.git
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install
```

If you have Composer in your path, things get easier. But you know the drill.

## Contributing
If you are a developer, we need your help. Cerberus RBAC is a young project and we have lot's of stuff to do. Some developers are contributing with new features, others with bug fixes. But you can also dedicate yourself to refactoring the current codebase and improving what we already have. This is very important, we want Cerberus to be a state-of-the-art application, and we need your help for that.
